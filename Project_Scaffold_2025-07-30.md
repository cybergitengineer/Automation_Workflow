# AI-Powered Vulnerability Scanner

This project aims to build a simple AI-powered vulnerability scanner using Python and Nmap. The scanner will utilize machine learning algorithms to identify potential vulnerabilities in a target system by analyzing the results obtained from Nmap scans.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vulnerability-scanner.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download and install Nmap from https://nmap.org/download.html

## File Structure

- `main.py`: Contains the main script for running the vulnerability scanner.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions for parsing Nmap scan results.
- `models/`: Directory for storing machine learning models.
- `data/`: Directory for storing Nmap scan results.

## Sample code for main.py

```python
import nmap
from utils import parse_nmap_results

# Initialize Nmap scanner
nm = nmap.PortScanner()

# Perform Nmap scan
target = '127.0.0.1'
scan_results = nm.scan(target, arguments='-sV')

# Parse Nmap results
vulnerabilities = parse_nmap_results(scan_results)

# Perform vulnerability analysis using machine learning models

# Print vulnerabilities
for vuln in vulnerabilities:
    print(vuln)
```

## Example Usage

1. Run the vulnerability scanner on a target system:

```
python main.py
```

2. View the identified vulnerabilities in the target system.

3. Perform further analysis and mitigation steps as necessary.
